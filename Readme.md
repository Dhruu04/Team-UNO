## Project Overview üöÄ
 It is a virtual conversational agent designed to provide mental health support, guidance, and psychotherapeutic interventions through text-based interactions.

## Tech Stack üíª

Python
libs: random,difflib,tkinter

example :

MindWell : Hi!! How are you feeling today??
You : I'm feeling like I'm not able to find motivation for my goals
MindWell :  Finding motivation is important for achieving goals. What goals are you struggling to find motivation for?
You : i want to get good grades
MindWell :  I'm here to provide information as well. Is there a question you'd like to ask me?
You : I'm feeling like I'm stuck in life
MindWell :  Feeling stuck can be frustrating. Can you elaborate on what's holding you back?
You : I'm feeling like I'm not able to find my life purpose
MindWell :  Finding one's life purpose can be a meaningful journey. What aspects of your life are you exploring to discover your purpose?


## Project Features and Functionality ‚ú®
Keyword-Based Responses:

Mindwell identifies keywords or phrases in user inputs and selects predefined responses based on these keywords.
It uses regular expressions and if-then rules to generate responses.
Generic Responses:

Mindwell has a set of generic responses that it uses when it doesn't recognize specific keywords or phrases.
These responses are designed to maintain the illusion of a therapeutic conversation.
Limited Therapeutic Value:

Mindwell's primary goal is to engage users in conversation rather than provide genuine therapeutic interventions.
Its responses are often repetitive and don't offer meaningful psychological help.
User Engagement:

Mindwell aims to keep users engaged by responding to their inputs and questions, creating the illusion of a supportive listener.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
User Input Processing:

Mindwell begins by taking in user input, typically in the form of text.
It then analyzes the input to identify keywords, phrases, and patterns using basic natural language processing techniques.

Keyword Recognition:

Mindwell's script contains a set of predefined keywords and phrases related to common psychological or therapeutic topics. These keywords cover a wide range of issues, such as "I feel," "my mother," "depressed," and so on.
The program identifies which of these keywords are present in the user's input.

## Challenges and Solutions üß†
Challenges : we weren't able to find the key value pairs for the dictonary we created and also could'nt figure out how to like it with a UI app.

## Future Enhancements üöß
we are planning to build a whole website for mental health support that can help the user overcome their problems.

## Screenshots and Demos üì∏
Showcase the visual aspects of our AI solution through screenshots or videos. If possible, include a link to a live demo or video demonstration.
